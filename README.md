# Web Development Project

Welcome to my web development project, a result of comprehensive training at Coderhouse Brasil. This project showcases the skills and best practices I acquired throughout the course.

## About the Project
This project is designed to be a representation of modern web development practices. Built from the ground up, starting from a prototype designed in Figma, it reflects a deep understanding of both the visual and functional aspects of web development.

## Key Features

- **Modular Structure**: The project is structured with distinct pages for different sections, such as Home, Design, Shop, Studio, and Videos. Each section has its dedicated styling, ensuring clarity and ease of maintenance.
- **Responsive Design**: Built with mobile-first in mind, ensuring a seamless experience across devices.
- **Optimized Performance**: Implemented best practices to ensure fast load times and smooth interactions.
- **Version Control**: Leveraged GIT for version control, ensuring organized and efficient code management.
- **Bootstrap Integration**: Utilized the Bootstrap framework to ensure a consistent and modern design.

## Technologies and Tools Used

- **HTML**: The backbone of the web, used for structuring the web content.
- **CSS**: Brought life to the web pages with styles and animations.
- **SASS**: Enhanced the power of CSS with the capabilities of this preprocessor scripting language.
- **Bootstrap**: Implemented this popular CSS framework to ensure responsiveness and utilize its rich component library.
- **Figma**: Used for creating the initial prototype, ensuring a user-centric design approach.
- **GIT & GitHub**: Employed for version control and collaborative development.

## Insights from the Course
The Coderhouse Brasil course offered a rich curriculum that focused on both the basics and advanced aspects of web development. From understanding the importance of a well-structured HTML document to diving deep into the intricacies of CSS, SASS, and responsive design using Bootstrap, the course was comprehensive. It not only emphasized the technicalities but also the importance of a user-centric design, something I practiced using Figma. Version control using GIT and GitHub, an essential aspect of modern development, was also a significant part of the learning.
